Landcover Classification
The ISMN data comes with information about landcover classification from the ESA CCI land cover project (years 2000, 2005 and 2010) as well as from in-situ measurements.
To use ESA CCI land cover variables for filtering the data in the get_dataset_ids function, set the keyword parameters (landcover_2000, landcover_2005 or landcover_2010)
to the corresponding integer values (e.g. 10) in the list below. To get a list of possible values for filtering by in-situ values (keyword parameter: “landcover_insitu”),
call the get_landcover_types method of your ISMN_Interface object and set landcover=’landcover_insitu’.
