Landcover Classification
The ISMN data comes with information about landcover classification from the ESA CCI land cover project (years 2000, 2005 and 2010) as well as from in-situ measurements.
To use ESA CCI land cover variables for filtering the data in the get_dataset_ids function, set the keyword parameters (landcover_2000, landcover_2005 or landcover_2010)
to the corresponding integer values (e.g. 10) in the list below. To get a list of possible values for filtering by in-situ values (keyword parameter: “landcover_insitu”),
call the get_landcover_types method of your ISMN_Interface object and set landcover=’landcover_insitu’.

The misuse of colour in science communication
Fabio Crameri 1✉, Grace E. Shephard 1 & Philip J. Heron2

BOX 2: 
Scientifically derived colour maps should be easily recognisable, and also be freely and readily available. While there are many online sources to download pre-made colour maps, and toolboxes to create colour maps, only few offer all the aspects required for use in science communication. Below, we mention the most accessible and/or robustly documented sources of scientifically derived colour maps, and outline their individual properties.

● Colorbrewer: The Colorbrewer colour maps (available at ref. 61) developed by Cynthia Brewer are provided through an online tool to manually produce and export a variety of discrete colour maps, which can, optionally, be colour-vision deficiency friendly and exported to a given a variety of formats. With the main aim being cartography, the online tool offers sequential, diverging and categorical (or in other words, qualitative) colour maps, but does not currently offer them in a continuous type.

● MPL (Matplotlib): The MPL colour maps (available at ref. 62) developed by Stéfan van der Walt and Nathaniel Smith. MPL maps aim for the most accurate perceptual uniformity with its widely applied colour maps being: viridis, magma, plasma and inferno. These maps have spearheaded the way towards more scientific colour mapping. The MPL colour maps are all sequential and continuous only. The MPL colour maps are openly available (currently for use with Python) and often built into software.

● Cividis: The cividis colour map38 (available at ref. 63), developed by Jamie R. Nuñez and colleagues, aims to represent an almost identical appearance for red–green colour-vision deficiencies, the closest of all currently available colour maps, while also being perceptually uniform. The colour-vision deficiency friendly, sequential and continuous colour map is currently available as a standard colour array.

● CMOcean (colormaps inspired by oceanography): The CMOcean colour maps20 (available at ref. 64), developed by Kristen M. Thyng and colleagues, aim to provide the most intuitive colours for a given suite of physical parameters, while now also being perceptually uniform. A variety of continuous sequential, diverging and cyclic colour maps are provided to allow for an intuitive, true representation of a given physical parameter field. The CMOcean colour maps are available in a large variety of file formats.

● CET (Centre for Exploration Targeting): The CET colour maps32 (available at ref. 65), developed by Peter Kovesi, aim to offer a large choice of the most common colour combinations in a wide variety of data formats. Many of the offered colour maps feature perceptual uniformity, although not all of them to the highest standards. The CET colour maps are continuous and cover sequential, diverging, and cyclic classes.

● Scientific colour maps: The Scientific colour maps30 (available at ref. 41, and permanently archived at ref. 52) are perceptually uniform (based on the underlying methodology of the CET colour maps65), perceptually ordered, colour-vision deficiency and colour-blind friendly, readable in black and white prints, and, if applied properly, also data set specific and parameter intuitive. The Scientific colour maps include sequential, diverging, and cyclic palettes, which are also provided as discrete and categorical palettes, and are available in a multitude of different file formats. They are also available through external routines and as built-in versions in a variety of software programmes. In contrast to others, the Scientific colour map package includes individual colour map diagnostics, and is versioned on a long-term online repository so individual versions can be accurately cited, which allows active developments from the community (e.g., improve their perceptual uniformity to the latest standards), and aids overall scientific reproducibility.
